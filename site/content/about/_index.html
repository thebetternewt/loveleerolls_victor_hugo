          We would love to sit down at our kitchen table and tell you how this all started. Doesn’t that sound odd? You might be thinking, “Don’t you mean discuss it over lunch and consistent cell phone use?” Your kitchen may not even have a table. Or if it does, it is probably a lonely place or a piece of furniture positioned so you can watch Netflix from in other room. And that’s Ok!
        </p>
        <p>
          But one thing we have learned throughout this process is that the kitchen and the table are special places. It’s where you share life with one another. It’s where people come in and experience the home.

          We started LoveLee Rolls in July of 2015 on our way back from the beach and it has been an interesting journey to say the least. It had been the perfect storm of an old college friend talking about how they were still the best cinnamon rolls he had ever had (six years later) and another friend asking us to make a batch for her to keep in her freezer. We thought, “I wonder if people would really buy these rolls?” We had been married for just over a year and our wedding theme was, “A LoveLee Wedding” (Might just be a Southern thing?) so we decided to give it a shot. LoveLee Rolls was born!
